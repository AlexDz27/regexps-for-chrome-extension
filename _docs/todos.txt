Todos:
  - need try-catch for regex (but it is out of scope for mvp)

Beauty:
  - #1: it does skipping of <body> Node. I think i can do that when filtering 

Possible bug:
  - #1: nextNode() should be only inside loop. otherwise could be buggy

Wrapping-up
  - safety for regexes? should also check chrome's guidelines
